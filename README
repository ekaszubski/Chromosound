- We can modify any part of any of the song structure at any time
- Changes will only take place at the next 'clock'
- The clock is different for each level of the structure
  - SongFSM: any time
  - MeasureFSM - beginning of the measure
  - NoteFSM - beginning of the note
  
- Changes to the size (ie duration) of each data structure will happen in a time-synchronized way
  - So we change the properties of the *next(in time)* data structure
  - Very similar to combinational logic in EE
  - Hierarchical, variable "clock" pulse durations
  
- Question: how can we naturally encode repeating rhythms?
- Specifically: in most songs, a core rhythm is determined and repeated throughout the
  duration of the song with occasional *temporary* modification
  - Solution1: leave this entirely up to the genome:
    a) Generate a population of rhythms
    b) Add a gene to control a rhythm pointer; this rhythm pointer will remain at this new value until it is changed by another gene
    c) NOTE: each chromosome will encode a rhythm; the population of rhythms will exist in the collective population of individuals
  -Solution2:
    a) See (a) in (1)
    b) Add a gene to control the playing different rhythm for a number of measures prior to reverting back to the original
    c) See (c) in (1)
  -Solution3:
    a) 

* Use structured genes (ie. AudioStateControl instead of int)
* TimeFSM - replaces an HMM in this encoding system
* SongFSM : TimeFSM - maintains clock for applying effects
  - global effects
  * MeasureFSM - maintains clock for committing changes to measures
    - key 
      - a primary and secondary key are picked for the song
      - a minor key select gene will:
        - temporarily change the key
        - define a short interval during which the key will remain changed before switching back to the previous key
      - a major key select gene will:
        - temporarily change the key from the current key to the secondary key
        - define a rather long interval during which the key will remain changed before reverting to the major key
        - override minor key select gene
    - time
      - same behavior as key 
    * Rhythm
      - times at which notes must start being played
      - the idea of a commit gene has been factored out of the generic gene space and encoded in a rhythm gene
      - the rhythm chromosomes will be long enough that they can encode the maximum possible time for the measure
      - if the time is shorter than the rhythm, the rhythm will be truncated
      - since a change in rhythm is allowed to happen at the positive edge of the measure clock, it's highly likely that the time and rhythm will change simultaneously, allowing for a more natural change of pace in the song
      - a primary/secondary rhythm and a major/minor rhythm select gene will also be used as with key and time
    * NoteFSM - maintains clock for committing changes to notes (dependent on current rhythm)
      - duration
      - pitch
